However, the way the tax is calculated and paid is different compared to someone who is an employee.\n\nAs a freelancer, you will need to register yourself as a taxpayer and obtain a Taxpayer Identification Number (NPWP) from the tax office. You will also need to file a tax return and pay the tax on your own, instead of having an employer withhold and remit the tax on your behalf.\n\nThe tax rate for PPh21 for freelancers is also based on a progressive tax rate system. The tax rate increases as the taxable income increases, and there are certain tax deductions and exemptions that may apply.\n\nIt is important to keep accurate records of your income and expenses as a freelancer to ensure that you are correctly reporting your taxable income and taking advantage of any applicable tax deductions.\n\nIn summary, freelancers in Indonesia are still required to pay income tax, including PPh21.
